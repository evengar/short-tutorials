This is a collection of short tutorials in specific topics in the R programming language. The tutorials were originally made for the course BIOS3000/4000 at the University of Oslo, but are general-purpose and hopefully useful to anyone learning R.

The guides are found here:

* [data import](https://evengar.github.io/short-tutorials/working_with_data_files.html)

* [data frames and subsetting](https://evengar.github.io/short-tutorials/short_dataframe.html)

* [plotting](https://evengar.github.io/short-tutorials/plot_in_r.html)

* [ggplot2](https://evengar.github.io/short-tutorials/ggplot_guide.html) (with special focus on plotting model predictions)
